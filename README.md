# Blackjack (C++) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ineshbose/Blackjack_CPP?style=flat-square)
Developed in order to repolish my C++ skills and as my first C++ repository. Have had many memories playing blackjack while being drunk with flatmates during the first year of uni.

## Using This Repository

### Cloning / Installing
You should have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and use the following commands in your terminal in your preferred directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ineshbose/Blackjack_CPP
$ cd Blackjack_CPP
```
else you can download a [ZIP](https://github.com/ineshbose/Blackjack_CPP/archive/master.zip).

### Running the Program
The main file in this repository, as the name would suggest, is `main.cpp`.

#### Windows
You **must** have [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) installed with the correct packages in order to compile C++ and then should use
```
> g++ main.cpp
```
which will create an executable file (usually named `a.exe`) that you can run by double-clicking or using
```
> a.exe
```
Hopefully, you can also compile `main.cpp` using an IDE.

#### Linux
You **must** have a gcc or g++ compiler which can be installed using
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
and then compile and run (assuming the file is named `a.out`) using
```
$ g++ main.cpp
$ ./a.out
```
