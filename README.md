# Blackjack (C++)
Developed in order to repolish my C++ skills and as my first C++ repository. Have had many memories playing blackjack while being drunk with flatmates during the first year of uni.

## How to Use this Repository
Cross-platform compatibility has been kept in mind while developing this project.

1. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/ineshbose/blackjack_cpp.git`

2. Enter the build directory

`cd Blackjack_CPP`

3. Compile `main.cpp`

`g++ main.cpp`

4. Run executable file!

`main.exe`

**Viola!**
